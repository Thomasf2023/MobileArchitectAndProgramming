<h1> Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? </h1>

The requirements that I had for the project where to create a project that would let the users keep track of their weight. I needed to allow they to see their weight and input their weight daily. It also needed to be able to notify them when they hit a weight goal. This app was designed to meet the user need of keeping track of their weight.

<h1>What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?</h1>

There were three differnt screens that were needed. The login screen, the info screen, and the notification screen. The login screen allowed the user to create an account and login, the info screen showed the info to the user and allowed them to input data, and the notification screen allowed the user to enable notifications.

<h1>How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?</h1>

The way that I approached this process was to follow the process of the class. It was laid out nicely where we did the UI for one project and then the Coding for another project. 

<h1>How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?</h1>

The way that I tested was manually, I used the app my self and tested out its features.

<h1>Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?</h1>

I had to innovate the display info screen. There was a lot that needed to be on the screen and getting the constraints right took a little bit of experimenting.

<h1>In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?</h1>

I think the UI design that I did was pretty good and I think that was my strong point.
